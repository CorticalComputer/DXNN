Comment                     The peptide behaved as a B-cell epitope in that immunization with free peptide in adjuvant resulted in anti-peptide production in mouse strain ,however these antibodies did not react with virus in either a solid-phase immunoassay or a virus neutralization assay

Comment                     MAb 1D9D5: Single chain antibodies, intrabodies, were engineered that can be stably expressed in the cytoplasm of mammlian cells - co-expression of an N-term Tat intrabody can ilicit transactivation of an HIV LTR-CAT construct and block import into nucleus, but intrabody specific for exon 2 did not inhibit activity.

Comment                     The Ab2 binding site overlaps the nuclear localization signal -- Ab2 binding to Rev was blocked by bound HIV RNA -- the cellular protein importin-beta can bind in this Arg rich region -- atypically, the Rev binds specifically to importin-beta, but not to the importin-beta-importin-alpha dimer.

Comment                     MAb 8E7: HIV-1 and Rev localize to the same region in the nucleoplasm, but the splicing factor SC-35 localizes in different speckles with the nucleoplasm than Rev - intron containing beta globin was distributed similarly to HIV-1, suggesting Rev and HIV-1 RNASs interact at putative sites of mRNA transcriptions and splicing.

Comment                     MAb G3-4: Called G3.4 - Deletingthe V2 loop of neutralization-resistant HIV-1 isolate SF162 does not abrogate its replication in PBMC or macrophages, but it enhances its neutralization sensitivity to sera from patients with B clade infection up to 170-fold, and also enhances sensitivity to sera from clades A through F - deletion of V1 or V2 did not enable neutralization by V2 MAbs G3.4, G3.136, or 687-30D.

Comment                     A panel of immunotoxins were generated by linking Env MAbs to ricin A -- immunotoxins mediated cell killing , but killing was not directly proportional to binding -- 110.1-RAC did not mediate cell killing , and sCD4 has no effect.

Comment                     MAb 1006-30-D: 26 HIV-1 group M isolates (clades A to H) were tested for binding to 47 MAbs, including two C2 MAbs - the binding of anti-C2 Mabs was weak to isolates from clades B,C,D,E,F,G, and they did not bind to isolates from subtypes A and H - epitope is suggested to be in a 20 amino acid peptide KGSCKNVSTVQCTHGIRPVV.

Comment                     MAb 847-D:26 HIV-1 group M isolates (clades A to H) were tested for binding to 47 MAbs, including two C2 MAbs - the binding of anti-C2 Mabs was weak to isolates from clades B,C,D,E,F,G, and they did not bind to isolates from subtypes A and H - epitope is suggested to be in a 20 amino acid peptide KGSCKNVSTVQCTHGIRPVV.

Comment                     MAb 8/38c: The MAb and Fab binding to the oligomeric form of gp120 and neutralization were highly correlated - authers suggest that neutralization is determined by the fraction of Ab sites occupied on a virion irrespective of the epitope.

Comment                     MAb 924: MAbs against the glycosphingolipid GalCer block HIV infection of normally susceptible CD4 negative cells from the brain and colon - this MAb can inhibit gp120 binding to GalCer in vitro.

Comment                     MAb 257-D : A T-cell line adopted (TCLA) derivative of SI primary isolate 168P acquired the ability to be neutralized by anti-V3 MAbs - the primary isolate could use either CCR5 or CXCR4, and was not neutralized when infection was directed via either pathway, however the TCLA derivative uses CXCR4 only and is neutralized.

Comment                     MAb 257-D : Kinetic parameters were measured, and the association rates were similar, but dissociation rate constants were quite variable for V3 MAbs, 257-D has a slow disociation, thus the highest affinity among V3 MAbs.

Comment                     MAb NM-01: The tip of the MN V3 loop was inserted into cold-causing human rhinovirus 14 (HRV 14) -- chimeras were immunoselected, and chimeric viruses were neutralized by anti-V3 loop antibodies, and NM-01 was among the Abs used -- chimeric viruses elicited potent MAbs in guinea pigs against ALA-1 and MN.

Comment                     HIV-1+ positive individuals were given a gp160 vaccine as immunotherapy, and this region was the most reactive new epitope as measured by a modified Pepscan technique whhich improved sensitivity -- 4/14 showed vaccine-induced reactivity.

Comment                     MAb M91: A panel of MAbs were shown to bind with similar or greater affinity and similar competition profiles to a deglycosylated or variable loop deleted core gp120 protein(del V1, V2, and V3), thus such a protein produces a structure closely approximating full length folded monomer.

Comment                     High titer response to ELDKWA and RILAVERYLKD was observed upon vaccination with multiple-epitope vaccine CG-GPGRAFYG-ELDKWA-G-RILAVERYLKD conjugated to BSA, with a weak response to GPGRAFY --immunization with CG-(ELDKWA-GPGRAFY)_2-K was also tried,yielding a strong Ab response to both ELDKWA and GPGRAFY --gp160 vaccination yielded strong AB response but not to any of the peptides studied .

Comment                     MAb B8: Ab response in IIIB lab workers was compared to gp160 LAI vaccine recipients - B8 was used as a control -- the dominant response among vaccinees was to this mid-gp41 region, but not among the infected lab workers - Abs binding this region do not neutralize, bind to infected cells, nor serve as immunotoxins.

Comment                     MAb 5023A: Called NEA-9205 - The N306 glycan of the V3 loop makes the tip of the V3 loop inaccessible to this MAb in oligomeric Env, loss of this glycan enhances neutralization sensitivity.
