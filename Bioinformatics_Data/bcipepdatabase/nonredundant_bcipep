Comment                     The Ab2 binding site overlaps the nuclear localization signal -- Ab2 binding to Rev was blocked by bound HIV RNA -- the cellular protein importin-beta can bind in this Arg rich region -- atypically, the Rev binds specifically to importin-beta, but not to the importin-beta-importin-alpha dimer.

Comment                     MAb 847-D:26 HIV-1 group M isolates (clades A to H) were tested for binding to 47 MAbs, including two C2 MAbs - the binding of anti-C2 Mabs was weak to isolates from clades B,C,D,E,F,G, and they did not bind to isolates from subtypes A and H - epitope is suggested to be in a 20 amino acid peptide KGSCKNVSTVQCTHGIRPVV.

Comment                     HIV-1+ positive individuals were given a gp160 vaccine as immunotherapy, and this region was the most reactive new epitope as measured by a modified Pepscan technique whhich improved sensitivity -- 4/14 showed vaccine-induced reactivity.

Comment                     MAb 8/38c: The MAb and Fab binding to the oligomeric form of gp120 and neutralization were highly correlated - authers suggest that neutralization is determined by the fraction of Ab sites occupied on a virion irrespective of the epitope.

Comment                     MAb 9284: In a study of the influence of the fraction of the glycan at position 306 of the V3 loop on MAb recognition, 9284 was found to have an inaccessible epitope on the oligomeric form of Env and anti-V3MAbs were found to neutralize an HIV-BRU mutant virus that lacks the V3loop glycan more efficiently than HIV-BRU.

Comment                     MAb C8: Ab response in IIIB lab workers was compared to gp160 LAI vaccine recipients - C8 was used as a control - the dominant response among vaccinees was to this mid-gp41 region, but not among the infected lab workers - Abs binding this region do not neutralize, bind to infected cells, nor serve as immunotoxins.

Comment                     MAb 924: Ab response in IIIB lab workers was compared to gp160 LAI vaccine recipients - MAb 924 was used as a control - infected lab workers and a vaccinia gp160 vaccine had strong V3 MAb response, but alum absorbed rec gp160 did not generate anti-V3 response.

Comment                     The variable region of B-cell epitope of the HIV-1 envelope elicits a virus-neutralizing antibody response during natural infection in humans and may therefore be considered for inclusion in a vaccine against HIV-1.
